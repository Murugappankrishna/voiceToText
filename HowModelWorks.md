# How ChatGPT Answers Your Questions
GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) doesn't "read" words in the way that humans do, but it processes them through a series of computational steps. Here's how it handles the words inputted by a user:

## 1.Tokenization:
- Initially, the text input from the user is broken down into smaller pieces,
much like splitting a sentence into individual words or even smaller parts. This process is called tokenization. For example, the sentence "ChatGPT is great!" might be split into three pieces: "ChatGPT", "is", and "great!". Each of these pieces is referred to as a token, and this breakdown makes it easier for the model to analyze the text and understand its structure.
## 2.Embedding:
- After the text is broken down into smaller pieces, each piece is then
converted into a numerical form, like a unique code, so that the computer can understand and work with it. This process is known as embedding. It's like translating the words into a language that the model can understand, where each word or piece gets its own unique numerical identifier. This way, GPT can process the text in a format that's suitable for mathematical operations, which are used in the later steps to analyze the text and generate a response.
- Within these unique codes are numerical values pertaining to semantic and syntactic information.
  ### Semantic Information
  - Semantic information relates to the meaning of words and their relationships with other words. For instance, consider the words "doctor," "nurse," and "hospital." Semantically, these words are related because they all pertain to healthcare. In the embedding space, they might be represented by vectors that are close to each other, indicating their related meanings. On the other hand, a word like "apple" which is unrelated to healthcare, might have a vector far from those of "doctor," "nurse," and "hospital."
  ### Syntactic Information:
  - Syntactic information is about the arrangement of words and
phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. It's like the framework or rules that dictate how sentences are constructed.
-n English, the typical word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). So, in the sentence "John eats apples," "John" is the subject, "eats" is the verb, and "apples" is the object. Syntactic information helps identify the correct order of words to make meaningful sentences.
## 3.Encoding:
In step 3, where the tokens are fed into the GPT model, we are essentially moving through a multi-layered network that refines the understanding of each token based on the tokens around it. So, let's break this down further:
### Layers:
- Layers: GPT has a series of layers (like floors in a building), and each layer
performs special operations on the incoming tokens. Imagine each layer as a kind of a workshop where tokens get refined or reshaped based on the surrounding context. GPT-3 for example has 175 billion parameters distributed across 96 Transformer layers.
### Transformation:
- In each layer, tokens are transformed through mathematical operations.
Think of this as a kind of translation from one language to another, helping
to build a richer understanding of each token. 
### Attention Mechanism:
- Within each layer, there's a mechanism called "attention" which allows each token to "look at" other tokens in the input and adjust its own representation based on what it "sees." For instance, the word "bank" might adjust its representation based on whether the surrounding words relate to a financial institution bank or the side of a river bank.

### Contextual Adjustment:
- The attention mechanism helps in adjusting the representation of each
token based on its context, making sure that the model understands each
word in a way that makes sense given the words around it. Passing Through Layers:
- Now, these refined tokens move up to the next layer (the next workshop) and go through a similar process again and again. With each layer they pass through, they gain a deeper understanding of the context.
Aggregation of Information:
- As tokens move through the layers, they aggregate and gather more and
more information from the surrounding tokens, which helps in building a rich, contextual understanding of the entire input.
By the time tokens reach the final layer, they have been significantly refined and carry a detailed understanding of the input text based on the context provided by the surrounding words. Each layer has contributed to building this deep understanding of the input, making the tokens ready for the next step, which is output generation.
##  4.Output Generation:
After processing the user's input, GPT begins the task of creating a response. It
starts with the tokens provided in the input and then works to predict what comes next, one token at a time.
## Prediction and Selection:
- For each new token, GPT looks at all the tokens that have come before it
(including the user's input and any tokens it has generated so far) to predict the most likely next token. It makes this prediction based on patterns it has learned from the vast amount of text data it was trained on.
- And then GPT selects the one that it calculates to be the most likely next token, based on its understanding from the training data.
When processing the input phrase "Albert Einstein was the world's most...", GPT would go through the following steps to predict and select the next word:
### Tokenization:
- The input phrase is tokenized into individual tokens, e.g., ["Albert",
"Einstein", "was", "the", "world's", "most", ...].
### Embedding:
- Each token is converted into a numerical vector using an embedding matrix.
### Processing Through Layers:
- The values are processed through the multiple layers of the GPT model.
Through self-attention mechanisms, the model identifies relationships between tokens, understanding, for instance, that "Albert Einstein" refers to a notable individual.
### Probability Distribution:
- Based on the context, the model computes a probability distribution over
the vocabulary for the next token after "most". Common continuations like
"famous", "influential", or "brilliant" might receive high probabilities.
- Now what is a probability distribution?
A probability distribution is like a rule that tells us how likely different outcomes are in a situation involving chance.
Imagine you have a jar of colored candies: red, blue, and green. If the candies are mixed equally, the chance of picking each color is the same, 1 out of 3, or about 33.3%.
Now, if we write down these chances for each color, we get a simple probability distribution:
- Chance of red: 33.3%
- Chance of blue: 33.3%
- Chance of green: 33.3%
In the case of GPT generating a word, think of it like the model has a huge jar of words, and some words are more likely to be picked next based on the previous words. The probability distribution is the rule that tells GPT how likely each word is to be picked next.
### Selection of 'influential':
- The model may then select the token "influential" as it has a high
probability and fits well with common descriptions of Albert Einstein.
###  Continuation:
- The model continues this process for each subsequent token, using the growing context to inform the prediction and selection of the next token. For instance, after "influential", it might predict "physicist" with high probability given the context of Albert Einstein.
### Stopping Criterion:
- The model continues generating tokens until a stopping criterion is met,
such as an end-of-sentence punctuation or a maximum token limit.
This process continues until we create the phrase = Albert Einstein was the world's most influential physicist of the 20th century, whose work revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe.
